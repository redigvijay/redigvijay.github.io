                <h6>Description:</h6>
                <p> It was our first attempt to do something bigger than us; to solve a problem that affected all of our fellow students. <br>The app was supposed to help us students decide on what we are going to eat next. We were all noobs then and we just stated with android development so it took us 3 months to convert a 'mess menu' pdf into a functional app. But these 3 months gave me a new direction as I embraced Design. <br> Our first attempt to address the challenge was incomplete so after 2 years of contemplation, user studies, and critical analysis, I am redesigning the app; that is HIVE.<br> Special thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kbhardwj/" target=_blank>Kaushal Bhardwaj</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lovish-jain-345269a9/" target=_blank>Lovish Jain</a>. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-item project-currency-intro">
                </div>
            <div class="project-item project-currency-iphone">
                <p> Our audience is iGeneration, the fast tech-savy generation also the most creative generation but also the generation that lives in a overload of corrupted information. I took depth <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kYFVHKBVsE48RW2x5vNYuCnyR5ki9916o9c1_9iIseY/edit?usp=sharing" target=_blank><b>interviews</b></a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfeSEHJcihTszjnqiPrY_0YqlLPnjQuWiQrdgw3Yj0mSXg-AQ/viewform?usp=sf_link" target=_blank><b>survey</b></a> to learn these critical things that we never knew about the users: 1. People only need to know about the next meal. 2. People trust recommendation from other users, reviews and ratings helps user in their decision. 3. We are social animals. 4. Food is taste and in digital world its all about photos as we can't smell and eat from our phones (right?) </p>
                <p> <img src="images/redigvijay-hive-goals-1x.jpg" alt="Things learned when designing Hive for iOS" width=408 height=156> </p>
                <div class="iphone-with-video project-currency-iphone-video"><p> The 3 main features of this app are present as the bottom navigation; swiping left or right switches to the next meal or discover food features respectively. This bottom navigation is present throughout the app at every hierarchy.</p><img class=lazy-load src="images/redigvijay-hive-iphone-landing.png" alt="Hive landing screen, work by redigvijay" width=231 height=500></div>
            </div>
            <div class="project-item project-currency-app-icon"> <img class=lazy-load src="images/redigvijay-hive-app-icon-2x.png" alt="Hive for iOS App Icon, work by redigvijay" width=126 height=126><p> Hive branding is done such that its infinite but also minimal, its structural and reliable but also creative and everchanging. Imagine a pattern of hexagons as in a bee-hive where each hexagon has its own unique gradient which changes continuously.<br> I tried to integrate the features of the brand into the app through gradient colors, hexagonal buttons, and motion. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="project-item project-currency-symbols"> <img class=lazy-load src="images/redigvijay-hive-next-meal-1x.png" alt="Hive for iOS, legacy next meal feature, work by redigvijay" width=440 height=543>
                The legacy feature from foodbuzz is redesigned, now it shows the next menu only. <br> A study found that 78% of participants trust recommendation from other consumers. So we implemented a different rating which not only reduce the cognitive efforts but also provides an extra reliable context to the user. This rating only consider the rating from user's social circle, the circular elements of the rating communicate the same idea.
            </div>
            <div class="project-item project-currency-process"> <img class=lazy-load src="images/redigvijay-hive-discover-food-1x.jpg" alt="Hive for iOS, Food Discovery Process, work by redigvijay" width=972 height=714>
                <p> In adventurous moments user may use the discover food feature which divides the search experience into 2 parts.<br> The first screen let you decide where and what to eat which is fairly easy to choose. The first screen allows you to choose and select different food articles from different categories, you can either search one of the food articles or search all of them together by clicking the location.<br> The second screen shows the result of the search through a map with location markers for food articles' location. Filters such as price, rating, time and show bookmarks improves efficiency and accuracy of the search.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-item project-currency-development"> <img class="lazy-load project-currency-image-development" src="images/redigvijay-hive-feed-narrow-1x.jpg" alt="Hive for iOS, social feed, work by redigvijay" width=750 height=1828 data-layout=narrow> <img class="lazy-load project-currency-image-storyboard" src="images/redigvijay-hive-feed-1x.png" alt="Hive for iOS, closeup feed, work by redigvijay" width=444 height=400 data-layout=wide> <img class="lazy-load project-currency-image-exploded-ui" src="images/redigvijay-hive-comments-1x.png" alt="Hive for iOS, closeup comments, work by redigvijay" width=455 height=454 data-layout=wide> <img class="lazy-load project-currency-image-source-code" src="images/redigvijay-hive-feed-wide-1x.jpg" alt="Hive for iOS, Social Feed, work by redigvijay" width=920 height=1098 data-layout=wide>
                <p> We tried to develop habit-forming behavior through the use of social feed which also increases the user engagement and retention rates. Hive's feed is similar to instagram but just for food; a dedicated social sharing platform for food photography. The context of the photo is kept minimal and is placed after the photo. The comment section is made such that the visual context of the text is not separated form rest of the comment section. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-item project-currency-localization"> <img class=lazy-load src="images/redigvijay-hive-restaurant-1x.png" alt="Hive for iOS, Food Discovery, work by redigvijay" width=1320 height=670>
                <p> The restaurant profile screen is designed to reduce, organize and prioritize the amount of information. The actions like show menu, navigate, call are present on the card with the rating and other general information. On top on the card, user can view the restaurant related photos and at bottom, the reviews. Reviews  provide a rich information to their readers and are likely to provide them with a tacit feel, beyond the numeric ratings. Two most accessible type of sorts - most helpful and most recent, play a significant role in organizing the reviews.<br><br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bjzRYkjmz9Y6D_99qU6PBPtD8PbKLqZ2/view?usp=sharing" target=_blank><b>Here you will find the UX case study</b></a> where I implement food delivery into Hive which results in a complete overhaul of the existing app. <br>Through case study you can find the way I approach the problem and how I solve it through my design process.</p>

                <p> Me, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kbhardwj/" target=_blank>Kaushal Bhardwaj </a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranay-pandey-b84183b6/" target=_blank>Pranay Pandey</a> decided to work on something and got hooked onto conversational-ui but later some fun was added as we made a 'pseudo' conversational-ui; a game. This game let user experience a story through hard-coded but still interactive chat. My job was to make sure it all feels real and user have a nice immersive experience. This app now has more than 58K downloads. </p>

            <div class="project-item project-thread-intro">
                <p> Our targeted audience were the fantasy junkies; people with good imagination; ~teenagers. The app got us interesting stats as the millennials(25-34) contributed to 1/3rd of our audience, 27% were the young-adults(18-25) and rest 40% was distributed in 35-65+ age groups. </p>

            <div class="project-item project-thread-mobile-desktop">
                <p> We created a sense of familiarity by introducing a pattern which is most commonly seen in chat-apps. We carefully use time to create anticipation and rush. Small clues like sent, seen and is typing gives this game a human touch. <br><br> User has to choose a response-dialog at every step in the story guided by the active/inactive send button. What user types is predefined but user still has to go from motions-of-typing(fake typing) it on a keyboard which is just buttons. </p> <img class="lazy-load project-thread-mobile-modals-narrow"  src="images/redigvijay-creepex-mobile-modals-narrow-1x.jpg" alt="Creepex modals design, work by redigvijay" width=750 height=1142 data-layout=narrow> <img class="lazy-load project-thread-mobile-modals-wide" src="images/redigvijay-creepex-mobile-modals-wide-1x.jpg" alt="Creepex modals design, work by redigvijay" width=1280 height=1650 data-layout=wide> <img class="lazy-load project-thread-mobile-components"  src="images/redigvijay-creepex-mobile-components-1x.png" alt="Creepex component library, work by redigvijay" width=345 height=892> </div>

                <p> Many users complained about the fake-typing after choosing the response-dialog. But what is a chat game where you don't type? Typing makes you experience the character, involve you directly into the story.<br> Thanks to Mr. Cinymix X's review we realized that showing people what they are typing, while typing, will improve the typing experience. So we added a view bar just above the ghost-keyboard, to show the word that the user is typing. </p>

            <div class="project-item project-thread-browse-intro-part-2">
                <p> This game can be completed in 15 minutes but there is always a demand for more stories and more personalization. So we are now working on the concept of a story-store which will sell different stories/chats/experiences to the users. It will be a open market for creative to create and maybe sell their stories which will, for now, only be sorted by date or popularity. </p>
